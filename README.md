## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

With this projet, I learned to build a slider in HTML/CSS. I also see for the first time the js function AddEventListener. I tried different event types for the slider, and input seems to be the best.

### Continued development

For this project, I need to attach a background image in the back. I did not find a good way, I am not really conviced. I always use querrySelector in js, I don't know if it is the good way.
